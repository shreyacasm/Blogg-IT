                To the people who feel too much as much they read,
                A very warm welcome to 
                my new & fresh blogging site.
                Do you know coming up with first blog post is always hard because 
                nobody knows you & nobody cares what are you doing. But here I am to 
                explore my interests and mix up them with yours. 
                <br/>
                If coming to my educational background, I am a software engineer, 
                <br/>so my interest lies always in world of technology. 
                <br/>
                The only reason I started blogging because it was fun 
                & it was something I enjoyed doing.
                <br/>
            </div>
