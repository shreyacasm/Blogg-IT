            `React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In 2019, React.js was the most loved web framework by developers worldwide, 
            according to the most recent survey done by StackOverflow. 
            At the time of writing this article, we found 184,565 React.js questions on the same 
            website and 111,612 npm packages, meaning that the future of React.js in 2020 is 
            brighter than the sun.`,  
            `Why do we love it? Because it helps us create the most engaging web apps efficiently 
            and fast with minimal coding. Since its release back in 2013, the goal of React.js was
             to provide outstanding rendering performance, considering its core strength is on individual
              components. Although it won the “battle” against Vue.js in 2019, things are changing 
              fast in the software development realm. For 2020, we anticipate the following React.js trends.`,
            `From a developer’s perspective, programming is art. They need to love the different tools they use, not just use them for the sake of programming. For us, at Thinslices, it’s a lot easier to work with tools that bring joy and pleasure. Here’s what one of our React.js rockstars has to say on that note: 

            “For me, as a software developer, building amazing, robust products is a top priority. I fell in love with React.js because it gives me a sense of joy and fulfillment when reusing components. By adhering to this rule “one function, one component”, I can stay focused on improving the re-usability of components. Rather than develop a new component to suit a function, I can work with an existing component that I already have for a function. This way, I don’t have to start all over again and maintain consistency when working on one or more projects.” (Dan Diac, Engineering Lead at Thinslices)`

            `Angular is a client-side based on an open-source framework maintained by Google. The library is capable of very first reading the HTML page, which provides additional custom tag attributes embedded into it. Those attributes are interpreted as directives that instruct Angular Framework to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources including any server-side data provider like REST API or others.`,
            `Why Angular is known as Framework?
 
            So before start discussing Angular, before that we need to understand What is Angular? Why did we call Angular as a Framework? As per the dictionary definition, a framework is an essential supporting structure. This single sentence definition very nicely sums up the Angular. But in spite of that, Angular provides a large and helpful ecosystem in which we can find many new tools and utilities, through which we can solve our problem and also can consider those for the new application structure and design. So, if we want to make our life harder and complex, then we need to write and develop our framework.
            
            So, in real life, it is not possible to develop a framework for ourselves. That’s why need to use any existing framework which supports our ideas and requirements. A good and stable framework like Angular is already tested and well understood by the others. The use of frameworks isn’t uncommon; many programmers from all environments of coding rely on them. Business application developers use frameworks, such as the Microsoft Entity Framework, to ease their pain and speed up development when building database-related applications. For example, Java programmers use the LibGDX framework to help them create games. I hope I have explained to you the need for a framework and, more specifically, the fact that AngularJS is a great choice. `

            `Augmented reality and virtual reality are often confused – but they’re more like technology cousins than twins. Let’s explain both in plain terms and examine some AR and VR use cases: `,
            `Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are often talked about in the same breath ­– and that can make sense for, say, measuring the market for these related capabilities. “AR and VR do share a lot of commonalities,” says Tom Emrich, AR/VR expert and managing director of Augmented World Expo. “And in a future of head-worn devices, these technologies will feel more like two sides of the same coin; the same device will allow us to experience augmented reality or virtual reality, depending on how much of the real world is necessary.”

            “For people who’ve never actually seen an AR or VR device, it's very easy to assume everything is VR.”
           However, AR and VR today are two distinct things – more like cousins than twins. VR gets much more coverage and AR can be more nebulous given the various ways in which it can be deployed, says Leon Laroue, technical product manager of augmented reality solutions for Epson. “For people who’ve never actually seen an AR or VR device, it’s very easy to assume everything is VR.”
           
           Since AR and VR are not one and the same, they require business leaders to devise different strategies for implementing these technologies in their organizations. Let's clarify the differences and look at some real-world examples.`,
           `AR vs. VR use cases : 
           “At a high level, AR applications are best suited for use cases where users need to be connected to and present in the real world,” Laroue explains. Some AR enterprise solutions include remote assistance, on-the-job training, remote collaboration, and computer-assisted tasks.
           
           “In our research of both technologies, we have found AR to be well-suited for industrial use cases, particularly workforce training and product maintenance,” says Michael M. Campbell, executive vice president, augmented reality products, at PTC. In particular, companies that are facing knowledge gaps and expertise loss as workers retire are capturing that knowledge digitally and sharing it with less-experienced workers via AR tools.`
